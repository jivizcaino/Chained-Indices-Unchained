## Packege Overview
This repository contains the complete replication package for the paper:

> **Licandro, O. and Vizcaino, J. I. (2025)**  
> *Chained Indices Unchained: Structural Transformation and the Welfare Foundations of Income Growth Measurement.*

The package includes:

- The **Julia replication code**  
- The **input data** used in the analysis  
- **Scripts and functions** to compute results and generate figures  
- A folder for **output figures**

All code is written to be fully **self-contained** and **portable**. It uses relative paths and a dedicated Julia project environment, so it should run identically on any machine.

## How to Run the Replication Code

1. Clone this repository 
Replace <your-username> and <your-repo> with your actual GitHub info:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>/Code
```

2. Start Julia with the project environment

```bash
julia --project=.
```

(or start Julia and run `] activate .>` in the REPL)

3.Instantiate the environment

Inside Julia:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.instantiate()     # installs all required packages
```

4. Run the main replication script

```julia
include("main.jl")
```

The script will:
- Load the Excel data from ../Data/
- Run the computations, including the SMM structural estimation
- Generate the figures
- Save the figures into ../Figures/
- Print the in the REPL all the calculations reported in the quantitative section of the paper

---

## Output
Running ```main.jl``` will create the output figures and save them in:

```Figures/```

It will also run the SMM structural estimation and print the in the REPL all the calculations reported in the quantitative section of the paper.
